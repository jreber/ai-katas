# My AI Katas
Prompt:
> I want to gain practice creating AI agents.
> Please suggest five "code kata"-style exercises to give me practice creating AI agents.
> (The questions should be tech-agnostic but I plan to use Langchain4j/Langgraph4j with Java or Clojure, probably using local Ollama models.)
